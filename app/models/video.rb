class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
  mount_uploader :attachment, VideoUploader # Tells rails to use this uploader for this model.
  validates :name, presence: true # Make sure the owner's name is present.
  
	# Note: The "public" directory (i.e. (name of application)/public) can build up with "failed" uploads.  
	# To upload a file, Carrierwave saves a copy of the file to the public folder before it performs 
	# validation.  If validations pass, Carrierwave will remove the temporary directory/files.  On the other 
	# hand, if validations fail, then the temporary directory/files will not get removed.  Subsequently, this
	# can build up quickly when there are lots of failed uploads.

	# Possible solutions:
	# 	1.  Used this solution (i.e. remove_tmp_directory() method) - https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/240
	#  	2.  https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/wiki/How-to:-Delete-cache-garbage-directories
	#   3.  use background server to run a rake task to clean this directory periodically - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19126504/cleanup-tmp-directory-with-carrierwave	
  # after_save is an additional callback that is available after mounting an uploader.  See - https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave
  after_save :remove_tmp_directory  # Removes public/tmp directory which contains "failed" carrierwave uploads.
  
  # The "meta-info" column in the video table can be used to store meta-data attributes by using the store method
  # This functionality is used in app/video_uploader.rb

  # To locally test the videos, after Zencoder has done
  # transcoding, do following in rails console
